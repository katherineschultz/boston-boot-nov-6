            <p>A craft approach to Men's Boots.</p>
            <p>We want to do for boots what microbreweries did for beer.  Bring back quality, character, and integrity to the products we use everyday.  And we are doing it the same way too, by making our boots in small runs, dedicating time to all the details and engaging in a zealous pursuit to find the best methods, materials, and technologies for our boots.</p>

            <p class="storyhead">OUR STORY</p>
            <p>Two guys, one with decades of industry knowledge and a desire to turn the category upside-down teamed up with a buddy with the connections to make it all happen. We added a 3rd, a talented-as-hell shoe designer with a cutting-edge sense of style. Our shared vision: to bring style, durability and comfort together in a pair of boots as resourceful as we are. In short, we wanted to make boots the right way.
            So we are setting out to build a better boot, and we started by looking out our window for inspiration. Our hometown of Boston is smart, rugged, classic in its style and bold in its innovation. We designed our boots that way. And of course, Boston is known for its crappy weather, so Boston Boots are weather-proof and built to handle whatever is thrown their way.</p>
            <p class="storyhead">WE USE THE BEST LEATHER KNOWN TO MAN</p>
            <p>Horween Leather Co. in Chicago is our exclusive supplier of the best leathers on the earth.  All of the leathers are waterproof, making our boots water resistant and durable in every weather condition.</p>

    We’re building Boston Boot Co for everyone that might have a little Boston in their soul.  No detail is minor.  Even a little eyelet is a big deal to us.  With a subtle nod to our hometown, this sophisticated detail will be only seen by the men who wear them.
